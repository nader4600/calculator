# calculator
Write a C++ program to create a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should continue to prompt the user for input until they choose to exit. Use a do-while loop to repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue calculations. If the user enters 'y' or 'Y', the program should continue; otherwise, it should terminate.
